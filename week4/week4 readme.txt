Calculates the values of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range [0,60] every five degrees

Function degtorad converts degrees to radians
Function integral computes the integral of f (x) = tan(x) from 0 ¡ú ¦Ð/3 by using the Trapezoidal rule
In line 24~25, we get tan(x) where x is in radians in the range [0,60] every five degrees
In line 28, we get the area under the curve of tan(x) from 0 ¡ú 60 degrees using the Trapezoidal Rule
