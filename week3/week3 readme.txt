Computes the integral of f (x) = tan(x) from 0 ¡ú ¦Ð/3 by using the Trapezoidal
rule

In line 9, we add the first and last terms of the polynomial to f(x)
In line 10~13, we add the remaining terms of the polynomial to f(x)
In line 10, we notice that the equal comparison between floats is different from that between integers
In line 14, we find that result is 0.69504485, approximately equal to log(2)=0.69314718
